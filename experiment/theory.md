# IoT Dashboard – Theory Module

An IoT Dashboard is a visual interface used to monitor real-time sensor data, device status, analytics, and alerts from remote IoT devices. It acts as a centralized control panel where users can view, analyze, and interact with IoT data using charts, gauges, numeric indicators, and maps.

In this experiment, we simulate designing an IoT dashboard using cloud platforms (such as ThingSpeak, Node-RED, Azure Dashboard, or Blynk) and connect it with sensor data generated by ESP8266/ESP32.

## Purpose of IoT Dashboards in Remote Monitoring

IoT dashboards are essential when data needs to be monitored from distant locations. They allow:

- Real-time tracking of sensor values  
- Visualization through graphs, charts, gauges  
- Alert generation on critical thresholds  
- Remote control of devices  
- Storing long-term data for analytics  

Dashboards convert raw sensor data into meaningful insights.

## Components of an IoT Dashboard

### Data Source (IoT Device)

ESP8266/ESP32 collects sensor data from:

- DHT11/DHT22 (Temperature & Humidity)  
- Soil Moisture Sensor  
- LDR (Light Intensity)  
- MQ Gas Sensors  
- Ultrasonic Sensor  

The ESP node publishes data to the cloud using HTTP/MQTT.

---

### Cloud Platform

A cloud server receives, stores, and organizes incoming data. Popular platforms:

- ThingSpeak  
- Node-RED Dashboard  
- Blynk IoT  
- Google Firebase  
- AWS IoT + Grafana Dashboard  
- Azure IoT Central  
- IBM Cloud IoT Dashboard  

The dashboard is created on these platforms for visualization.

---

### User Interface (Dashboard Widgets)

Dashboards include UI elements such as:

- Line Graphs (Temperature trend)  
- Bar Graphs  
- Gauges / Speedometers  
- Numeric Displays  
- LED Indicators (Online/Offline)  
- Switches for Remote Control  
- Maps for GPS data  

These elements allow interactive monitoring.

## Data Flow in IoT Dashboard Architecture

1. Sensors collect physical data  
2. ESP8266/ESP32 reads sensor values  
3. Data is sent to the cloud server via MQTT/HTTP  
4. Cloud stores and processes data  
5. Dashboard visualizes data using widgets  
6. User monitors the system remotely  
7. (Optional) Dashboard sends control commands back to ESP  

This forms a full IoT monitoring loop.

## Steps in Creating an IoT Dashboard

### Step 1: Configure the Cloud Account
Create an account on platforms such as ThingSpeak, Blynk, Azure, etc.

### Step 2: Create Channels or Devices
Define fields:
- Field 1 → Temperature  
- Field 2 → Humidity  
- Field 3 → Soil Moisture  
- Field 4 → Gas Level  

### Step 3: Connect ESP8266/ESP32
Use:
- API Keys  
- Broker URLs  
- Device Tokens  

ESP transmits live data to the cloud.

---

### Step 4: Add Dashboard Widgets
Include widgets such as:

- Graphs  
- Gauges  
- Switches  
- Digital Readouts  
- Status Indicators  

Map each widget to a cloud field.

---

### Step 5: Test Live Data Updates
Ensure the dashboard updates instantly as sensor values change.

### Step 6: Enable Alerts / Notifications (Optional)
Examples:
- Temperature > 40°C → Email/SMS  
- Unsafe Gas Level → Alert notification
