### Procedure for the experiment is as follows:

1. Open the experiment in the virtual lab for creating an IoT remote monitoring dashboard.  
   A pre-designed static dashboard with multiple charts and widgets is already displayed in the workspace.

2. Observe the dashboard layout.  
   Check the different charts, gauges, indicators, and data panels arranged on the dashboard.  
   Identify which chart represents which type of parameter (temperature, humidity, light, motion, etc.).

3. Start the dashboard simulation.  
   Click the "Start Dashboard" or "Start Simulation" button as provided in the interface.  
   The dashboard will begin generating random simulated values for all its charts and data widgets.

4. Monitor the live data updates.  
   Observe how graphs change in real time with new random data points.  
   Check how the indicators, gauges, and line charts update continuously with simulated sensor data.

5. Interact with the dashboard if required.  
   Some dashboards may allow switching views, expanding charts, or pausing data updates.  
   Explore these controls to understand dashboard functionality.

6. Record observations.  
   Note the behavior of each chart and how data values appear, refresh, or animate over time.  
   Observe how different visualizations represent the same data category in different formats.

7. Stop the simulation.  
   Click the "Stop Dashboard" or "Stop Simulation" button after reviewing the dashboard.
