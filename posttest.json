      "question": "What is the main purpose of an IoT dashboard in remote monitoring?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To display real-time data from IoT devices",
        "b": "To only control devices manually",
        "c": "To design IoT hardware circuits",
        "d": "To replace cloud storage"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. An IoT dashboard visually represents real-time data from IoT devices for monitoring and analysis.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While dashboards can allow control, their main purpose is monitoring.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Hardware design is done separately.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Dashboards use cloud storage but do not replace it."

        "a": "Arduino or ESP8266",
        "b": "LED display",
        "c": "Power bank",
        "d": "Keyboard"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Microcontrollers like Arduino or ESP8266 send sensor data to cloud platforms.",
        "b": "Incorrect. LED displays only show local output.",
        "c": "Incorrect. A power bank only provides power.",
        "d": "Incorrect. A keyboard is not used for IoT data transmission."

      "question": "Why is cloud connectivity important in an IoT dashboard system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It enables remote access to device data from anywhere",
        "b": "It makes the system faster than local storage",
        "c": "It removes the need for sensors",
        "d": "It allows offline operation only"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Cloud connectivity allows the dashboard to be accessed from anywhere with internet.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Speed is not the main reason for cloud use.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Sensors are still needed to collect data.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Cloud systems require internet, not offline mode."
